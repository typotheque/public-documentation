*Updated: 27 May 2025*

# Spelling and punctuation
- UK spelling
- Dictionary: New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors 
- ise verb forms: recognise, realise
- Compound adjectives containing an ‘-ly’ adverb do not need a hyphen: his highly polished black shoes, ethically sourced, globally famous
- UK punctuation: commas and periods outside quotation marks: an end to the ‘world-wide carnage’,
- **Quotes**: single quotes throughout, but double inside single as needed. ‘a “pure” geometric reproduction, not a typographic one’ 
- **Dashes**: spaced em dashes for parenthetical dashes
- **Apostrophe**: Brooks’, Texas’, Miralles’, Barthes’
- **No apostrophe** around font names
- **No serial/Oxford** comma in lists
- **Ellipses**: to show omission in quoted text (square brackets […]) or pause in speaking… With the latter: no space before, space after (unless at end of sentence). 
- Captions and footnotes: A full stop at the end
- **Footnote markers** outside punctuation: e.g. the specific “there” of film watching.
- See Word List for specific spellings
- Compound modifiers: hyphenate:
- - life-changing moments
- - box-office earner
- - black-and-white pictures
