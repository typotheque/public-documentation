# Designer orientation

## Glyph naming

In the industry standard naming syntax, an underscore (`_`) joins **existing glyphs** to form a **ligature** of those glyphs, while a dot (`.`) appends a suffix to an **existing glyph** to form a **variant** of that glyph:

```
liga_ture.vari.ation
```

The Glyphs app introduced additional syntax, where a dash (`-`) appends a suffix to differentiate the preceding name (or all ligated names) between scripts:

```
liga_ture-script.vari.ation
```

## Outline direction

Filled outlines must be counterclockwise, and inside (carved out) outlines clockwise.

## Source control

Syncronize with GitHub before working on a file. Push your changes to GitHub at least at the end of your work day.
