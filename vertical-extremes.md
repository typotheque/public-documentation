# Vertical extremes in common texts

Notes:

- For each script or orthography, two lines are given: The upper has extreme descenders, and the lower has extreme ascenders.
- The two lines may then collide because the line height is not enough. That’s exactly the point of this doc.
- Within each line, cases are roughly ordered from frequent to less frequent (but more extreme).
- Letter _ka_ is used as the placeholder base by default. If it has an unusual structure in a script, a letter later in the alphabet is used instead.

## Scripts and orthographies

### Devanagari देवनागरी

> कू डू ड्रू ड्डू <br>
> कँ कॅं र्क

Notes:

- कँ (with _candrabindu_) is used in standard Hindi, while कॅं (with _candra e_ and _anusvara_) is used in Marathi for loan words (eg, बॅंक “bank”). The latter is typically shaped to be confusable with the former and thus has a similar ascender size.

### Gujarati ગુજરાતી

> ખૂ ડૂ ડ્રૂ ડ્ડૂ <br>
> ખૅં ર્ખિં

Notes:

- ખૅં (with _candra e_ and _anusvara_) is supposed to be used in the Devanagari–Marathi way, but in reality Gujarati usually spells words like “bank” as બેંક (with _e_ and _anusvara_). Gujarati doesn’t use _candrabindu_.
