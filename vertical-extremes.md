# Vertical extremes in common texts

Notes:

- For each script or orthography, two lines are given: The upper has extreme descenders, and the lower has extreme ascenders.
- The two lines may then collide because the line height is not enough. That’s exactly the point of this doc.
- Within each line, cases are roughly ordered from frequent to less frequent (but more extreme).
- For dependent signs, the letter _pa_ is typically used as the placeholder base.

## Scripts and orthographies

### Devanagari देवनागरी

> पू डू ड्रू ड्डू <br>
> पँ पॅं र्पैं र्पिं

Notes:

- पँ (with _candrabindu_) is used in standard Hindi, while पॅं (with _candra e_ and _anusvara_) is used in Marathi for loan words (eg, बॅंक “bank”). The latter is typically shaped to be confusable with the former and thus has a similar ascender size.

### Gujarati ગુજરાતી

> પૂ ડૂ ડ્રૂ ડ્ડૂ <br>
> પૅં ર્પૈં ર્પિં

Notes:

- પૅં (with _candra e_ and _anusvara_) is supposed to be used in the Devanagari–Marathi way, but in reality, those loanwords are usually spelt with _e_ and _anusvara_ (eg, બેંક “bank”). Gujarati doesn’t use _candrabindu_.
