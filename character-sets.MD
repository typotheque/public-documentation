# Typotheque character set for new fonts

Since 2026, Typotheque standartised the character set for future font releases, aligning the glyph names with [GlyphsApp](https://glyphsapp.com). We provide recommended glyphs names in a plain text format, so they can be imported to the font editor of your choice. Typotheque has three levels of the Latin character sets:

- Level 0, Bare minimum (for very graphic intense fonts such as [History](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history), [Wind](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/wind), etc)
- Level 1, Typotheque Latin Display (for standard display fonts, such as [Tremolo](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/tremolo), [Brenner Display](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/brenner-display), etc)
- Level 2, Typotheque Latin Text (for standard text fonts, such as [Rapida](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/rapida), [Amalia](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/amalia), etc)
- Level 3, Typotheque Latin Text + indigenous NA language support (a small selection of fonts, such as [Lava](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/lava) or [November]](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/november))
